## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge is built with a mobile‑first approach, following BEM naming methodology and accessibility requirements.
I followed the design visually without aiming for a pixel‑perfect result.

The first difficulty I ran into was organising the layout for large screens.

I solved this by using CSS Grid: auto-fit to create two columns on screens smaller than 1000px, and explicit grid-area placement for each item on larger screens. Everything became much simpler once I realised the layout required ten rows.



### Continued development

I want to explore more on CSS grid.
